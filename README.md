# PairAssignment3

This repo contains [Jonas Markgraf's](https://github.com/jmarkgraf) and [Malte Berneaud-KÃ¶tz's](https://github.com/mberneaud) work for the third pair assignment in the Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis course at the Hertie School of Governance. 

**Instrucutor**: Christopher Gandrud

## Note regarding the data sets used in the analysis

As we do not intent to publish the data used in the analysis publicly, it needs to be manually inserted into the `data/`  directory. Otherwise, the RMarkdown will not render correctly as one of the earlier code chunks will throw an error right away. 

*Note to Christopher: We'll have sent you the data along with the repository link via email.


## Important files

The entirety of the analysis is done within the [RMarkdown file](PairAssignment3.Rmd), the rendered output of that file is the [PairAssignment3.pdf](PairAssignment3.pdf). There are some R source files found in the `R_scripts` folder, but they are not directly integrated into the Rmarkdown file.
