## Note regarding the data sets used in the analysis

As we do not intent to publish the data used in the analysis publically, it needs to be manually inserted into the `data/` directory. Otherwise, the RMarkdown will not render correctly as one of the earlier code chunks will throw an error right away. 

*Note to Christopher: We'll send you the data along with 


## Important files

The vast majority of the analysis is done within the [RMarkdown file](PairAssignment3.Rmd), the rendered output of that file is the [PairAssignment3.pdf](PairAssignment3.pdf).
